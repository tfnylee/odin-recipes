        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is the best French toast recipe. It's different because it uses flour. I have given it to some friends and they've all liked it better than the French toast they usually make! Top this French toast with maple syrup, powdered sugar, and fresh fruit (such as sliced strawberries and bananas) for a beautiful and delicious presentation.
